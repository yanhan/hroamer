# hroamer

A plain text file manager using your text editor for manipulations.

Writing this so I can work on something more real world using Haskell.

Inspired by https://github.com/abaldwin88/roamer


## Warnings about the code

Because this is the first non-trivial Haskell project I've worked on

- The code does not look good at all
- There is a lack of tests
- Usage of cabal file may be wrong in that I didn't specify library versions
- Possibly many non idiomatic usages of Haskell. I have tried to make the code as Haskell as possible, to the best of my ability
- Code organization is far from ideal. Currently all the code that does the hard work is in one file
